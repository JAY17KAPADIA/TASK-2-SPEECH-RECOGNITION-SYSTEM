## Speech Recognition System
This Python script is a real-time speech-to-text converter that captures audio through a microphone, transcribes it using Googleâ€™s Web Speech API, and saves raw audio as timestamped WAV files. Developed with the speech_recognition library, it offers an easy-to-use tool for voice-based transcription. The script is designed to run continuously, capturing and transcribing speech until manually stopped, making it ideal for use cases like interviews, lectures, or dictation.

This Speech Recognition GUI is a powerful Python-based desktop application designed to convert spoken language into text using both live microphone input and pre-recorded audio files. Built using the PyQt5 framework, it offers an intuitive and interactive graphical interface with a sleek dark-themed design. The application leverages the speech_recognition library for handling real-time audio transcription and pydub in conjunction with FFmpeg for broad format support and internal audio conversion.

The project is ideal for users who need a quick, accurate, and visually appealing tool for transcription tasks such as dictation, interviews, podcast processing, and multilingual speech analysis.
